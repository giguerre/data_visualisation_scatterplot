# Homework N°1: ScatterPlot
##
**An useful invention in the history of statistical graphics**

“Scatter plots have been called the “most versatile, polymorphic, and generally useful invention in the history of statistical graphics” (Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, 2005). That’s a big claim, but just as their name implies, they can take a confusing and scattered set of data and make sense of it. As such, these plots are much more than a visualization tool; they are a discovery tool. Let’s look at what makes the scatter plot so good.”

**A Simple Benefit from this statistical graphics**

They can show large quantities of data and make it easy to see correlation between variables and clustering effects. As a quick overview and analytical tool, scatterplots are invaluable and work with almost any continuous scale data.

**Ok it's an efficient component for correlation!  but?**

Scatterplots may not be used too often in infographics, but they definitely have their place. They can show large quantities of data and make it easy to see correlation between variables and clustering effects. As a quick overview and analytical tool, scatterplots are invaluable and work with almost any continuous scale data.

Unfortunately, scatterplots aren’t always great for presentation. Several problems occur frequently, and it’s best to be aware of each when using scatterplots for analysis or presentation.

A scatterplot works by placing one dimension on the vertical axis and a different dimension on the horizontal axis. Each piece of data is represented by a point on the chart. Variations on scatterplots introduce differently shaped or colored points for categories and differently sized points for quantitative data. Occasionally, people use pie charts as the points in scatterplots to show even more data with a part-whole relationship.

**Hmm a lot of technical word,but can you just tell me what's are the major cause of problems facing scatterplot?**

The major cause of problems with scatterplots is discretization of values. This happens when decimal places are rounded off, measurements are not accurate enough, or a data field is categorical. The scatterplot below uses a standardized dataset about cars. The problems with this scatterplot all derive from the x-axis; number of cylinders. There are so few values that cylinders is really a categorical scale being represented using numbers. This causes overplotting problems so there are hundreds of values all stacked on top of each other. This makes it difficult to see the full quantity of values in the dataset, and correlation and clustering is harder to find with so few possible values on the x-axis.
